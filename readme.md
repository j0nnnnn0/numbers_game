# Number's game
We want to learn Python using small and fun exercises

## guess the number
- Using the random function , we prompt the user to guess a number.
- We introduce a loop to limit the number of guesses

## Word Reversal:
- Ask the user to enter a word and write a program that reverses the word and prints the result. 
- For example, if the user enters "Python," the program should output "nohtyP."

## Fibonacci Sequence:
- Write a program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. 
- Prompt the user for the number of terms and then calculate and display the sequence.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors:
- Create a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the user can play against the computer. 
- Prompt the user for their choice and randomly select the computer's choice. Determine the winner based on the game rules and display the result.

## Even or Odd:
- Write a program that asks the user for a number and determines whether it is even or odd. 
- Print a message indicating the result.

## Sum of Digits:
- Prompt the user for an integer and calculate the sum of its digits. 
- Print the result.

## Factorial:
- Ask the user for an integer and calculate its factorial. 
- Print the result.

## Palindrome Check:
Prompt the user for a word or phrase and determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). 
- Print the result.
